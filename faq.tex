\chapter{Frequently asked questions\label{chap:faq}}

In addition to the information provided in
chapter~\ref{chap:introduction}, here are some brief notes on
references (see section~\ref{sec:references}) and figures (see
section~\ref{sec:figures}).

\section{References\label{sec:references}}

You can, of course, use any referencing style you like such as
\verb+plain+.  The \verb+natbib+ package, however, allows you to do
this with named style citations:

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{3in} \= \kill
\verb-\citet{key}- \> Jones et al. (1990) \\
\verb-\citet*{key}- \> Jones, Baker, and Smith (1990) \\
\verb-\citep{key}- \> (Jones et al., 1990) \\
\verb-\citep*{key}- \> (Jones, Baker, and Smith, 1990) \\
\verb-\citep[chap. 2]{key}- \> (Jones et al., 1990, chap. 2) \\
\verb-\citep[e.g.][]{key}- \> (e.g. Jones et al., 1990) \\
\verb-\citep[e.g.][p. 32]{key}- \> (e.g. Jones et al., p. 32) \\
\verb-\citeauthor{key}- \> Jones et al. \\
\verb-\citeauthor*{key}- \> Jones, Baker, and Smith \\
\verb-\citeyear{key}- \> 1990 \\
\end{tabbing}

This template uses BibTeX as the citation engine, and you should learn to fill in citations correctly, perhaps even use a bibfile manager like \href{https://www.jabref.org}{JabRef}. 
Recall that when citing a book, you should always include the chapter, for example, the first chapter of the classic AI book~\cite[Ch. 1]{RussellNorvig2022}. 
Papers are easier to cite, such as a recent AAAI paper~\cite{Amado2022}. 

\section{Figures\label{sec:figures}}

To include an encapsulated postscript or PDF file (depending on whether you're using \LaTeX or PDF\LaTeX) as a figure, do
something like the following.  Note, to ensure correct
cross-referencing, it is best to include the figure label within
the caption definition.  \emph{Note that the graphicx package 
is already loaded and used to include the
University crest on the title page.}

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}
 \begin{center}
   \includegraphics{myfigure.pdf}    
   \caption{This is my figure.\label{fig:mylabel}}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Frequently used symbols\label{sec:fus}}

In \LaTeX\ documents where you want to use a modality or some text consistently in normal text and in equation environments it is often difficult to remember to typeset the text consistently or time-consuming to keep typing in the environment. It may be a good idea to define something like the following in the preamble (i.e.\ before \verb+\begin{document}+):

\begin{verbatim}
\def\sfthing#1#2{\def#1{\mbox{{\small\normalfont\sffamily #2}}}}

\sfthing{\PP}{P}
\sfthing{\FF}{F}
\end{verbatim}

Then use it in text or math mode. In all cases it looks the same; e.g.\\
\verb+\PP\ refers to something, and other things are \FF; $\Phi = \PP\cup\FF$+\\
is typeset as:

\PP\ refers to something, and other things are \FF; i.e.\ $\Phi = \PP\cup\FF$

Note that you need to put ``\textbackslash'' after the command if you want a normal space after it.
